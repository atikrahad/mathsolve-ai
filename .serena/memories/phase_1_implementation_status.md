## Database Schema Highlights
- **9 Core Models**: User, Problem, Solution, Resource, Comment, Achievement, UserFollow, ProblemRating, Bookmark
- **Rich Relationships**: Following system, problem ratings, nested comments, bookmarking
- **Gamification**: Rank points, achievements, streak tracking
- **Content Management**: Problems with categories, difficulties, tags, quality scores
- **Community Features**: Comments, ratings, following, bookmarks

## Sample Data Seeded
- 5 realistic user profiles with different skill levels
- 8 diverse math problems across multiple categories (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Statistics)
- 5 comprehensive learning resources (tutorials, guides, references)
- Solutions, achievements, user follows, ratings automatically generated
- All data interconnected with realistic relationships

## Configuration Highlights
- **Environment Variables**: Comprehensive .env templates for all services
- **Security**: JWT secrets, CORS origins, rate limiting, helmet configuration
- **Logging**: Winston with file rotation, different log levels for dev/prod
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL ready for production
- **Caching**: Redis integration ready for performance optimization
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Claude, Wolfram Alpha API integration ready

## Development Workflow Ready
1. **Setup**: Run `scripts/setup-dev.bat` or `scripts/setup-dev.sh`
2. **Development**: Use `npm run dev` to start all services concurrently
3. **Individual Services**: `npm run dev:web`, `npm run dev:api`, `npm run dev:mcp`
4. **Database**: `npm run db:migrate`, `npm run db:seed`, `npm run db:studio`
5. **Docker**: `npm run docker:up` for containerized development
6. **Testing**: `npm run test` (framework ready, tests to be added in later phases)

## URLs and Endpoints
- **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Server**: http://localhost:5000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/health
- **MCP WebSocket**: ws://localhost:5001
- **Database Studio**: Available via `npm run db:studio`

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
Phase 1 provides a solid foundation for Phase 2 (Authentication System). All infrastructure is in place to implement:
