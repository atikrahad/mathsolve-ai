In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of algebraic expressions and equations.\n\n## Variables and Constants\nA variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown value. Constants are fixed values that don't change.\n\n## Basic Operations\n- Addition: a + b\n- Subtraction: a - b  \n- Multiplication: a × b or ab\n- Division: a ÷ b or a/b\n\n## Solving Linear Equations\nTo solve ax + b = c:\n1. Subtract b from both sides\n2. Divide by a\n\nExample: 2x + 5 = 11\n1. 2x = 6\n2. x = 3",

    "content": "# Understanding Limits\n\nLimits are fundamental to calculus. They describe the behavior of a function as the input approaches a certain value.\n\n## Definition\nThe limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, written as:\nlim(x→a) f(x) = L\n\n## Key Properties\n1. Limit of a constant is the constant\n2. Limit of x as x→a is a\n3. Sum rule: lim[f(x) + g(x)] = lim f(x) + lim g(x)\n4. Product rule: lim[f(x) × g(x)] = lim f(x) × lim g(x)\n\n## Common Limits\n- lim(x→0) (sin x)/x = 1\n- lim(x→∞) 1/x = 0\n- lim(x→0) (e^x - 1)/x = 1",
